/**
 * TitleFolder.h - What a Switch title is CALLED, on screen and on the SD card.
 *
 * THREE STRINGS, AND THEY ARE NOT ONE STRING:
 *
 *   titleDisplayLabel() goes under a 184-pixel tile in the save picker. Short.
 *   titleDisplayName()  is prose -- the title bar, and "This replaces X's save data". Readable.
 *   titleFolderName()   is a directory under sdmc:/PKSE holding that title's backups. UNIQUE.
 *
 * They were one string, built from the GameVersion alone, and a GameVersion is not an identity.
 * Gen 3's Switch release ships ONE APPLICATION PER LANGUAGE -- the GBA originals had no in-game
 * language option, so the eShop sells a separate SKU per localisation, twelve ids across the six
 * GBA languages and two games. Every one resolves to the same GameVersion, correctly, because the
 * SAVE is identical. So the picker drew several tiles all reading "LeafGreen" with nothing to
 * choose between them, and every one pointed at sdmc:/PKSE/Pokemon LeafGreen -- opening the French
 * title loaded whatever English bytes were already in that folder, and saving with inject on would
 * have written them into the French title. Nothing failed and nothing logged.
 *
 * THE FOLDER CARRIES THE WHOLE TITLE ID, FOR EVERY TITLE, WITH NO EXCEPTIONS. Not just the ones
 * known to collide -- uniformly, because a rule that applies to the cases somebody has thought of
 * is the rule that broke here. A hand-kept list of somebody else's title ids cannot be complete:
 * an id PKSE has never seen is identified by CONTENT, and content answers with a GROUP, so without
 * the id an Italian FireRed and an Italian LeafGreen collide with each other as well as with every
 * other unlisted Gen 3 SKU. The id is distinct by definition; a name is not, and no amount of
 * curating the name list changes that.
 *
 * The id stays OUT of the two display strings, because it is not something to read -- it is there
 * so the directory cannot lie about which title it belongs to.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inside the picker because the picker and the backup screen both need it,
 * and because a naming rule with two copies is what SaveFileName.h exists to prevent.
